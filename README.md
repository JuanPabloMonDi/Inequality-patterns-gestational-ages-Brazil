# Analyzing a decade of regional inequality patterns in Small for Gestational Age and Infant Mortality in Brazil

The construction of this Readme is still on progress.

Some of the information that will be explained here will be:

-   Since the data is too large and heavy to be uploaded, we will provide the information of where to obtain the Births and Deaths datasets used (<https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/>) and subnotification (<https://ftp.ibge.gov.br/Estatisticas_Vitais/Estimativas_sub_registro_nascimentos/2018/xlsx/> )

-   The link to a Google Drive folder with some RData to give the option to avoid intensive computation parts.

-   Explain a little bit about each file and folder

-   Provide citation that must be used on this github (the same citation of the article)

-   Provide a brief context of the article
